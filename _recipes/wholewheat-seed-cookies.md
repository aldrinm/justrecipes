#    Yield About 4 dozen cookies
#    Time About 45 minutes

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup/60 grams whole-wheat flour
- 1/2 cup/65 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon/2 grams baking soda
- 4 ounces (1 stick)/ 115 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup/50 grams organic granulated sugar (regular will work also)
- 1/2 cup/80 grams packed light brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon/2 grams fine sea salt
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla/5 milliliters
- 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons/50 grams sunflower seeds
- 2 heaped tablespoons/25 grams pumpkin seeds
- 1 tablespoon/12 grams chia seeds
- 1/2 cup (scant)/50 grams rolled oats
- 8 ounces/225 grams bittersweet chocolate (or more if desired), cut in 1-inch pieces

directions:
- Sift together flours and baking soda and set aside. In bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter until lemony yellow, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of the bowl and paddle. Add organic sugar, brown sugar and salt. Continue creaming mixture on medium speed until it is lump free, about 1 minute. Stop mixer and scrape down sides of the bowl and the paddle.
    
- Add egg and vanilla and beat on low speed for 15 seconds, or until they are fully incorporated. Do not overbeat. Scrape down sides of the bowl and paddle.
    
- On low speed, add sifted flour mixture. Beat slowly until all of the flour is incorporated. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add seeds, oats and chocolate chunks and mix in.
    
- Heat oven to 350 degrees with racks adjusted to the lower third and middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Spoon dough by heaped teaspoons (or use a 1-inch scoop) 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.
    
- Bake 14 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned, rotating baking sheets from top to bottom and from front to back halfway through the baking. Remove from oven and slide parchment off the baking sheet and onto a work surface. Allow cookies to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving, or for at least 20 minutes before storing in an airtight container. Cookies will keep for three days at room temperature.

notes:    
- If you want your cookies to be flat and crispy, when you go to turn the baking sheets back to front halfway through the baking, tap them down on the back of the oven door before sliding them back in. This will cause the rising cookies to fall.
- Measurements for dry ingredients are given by weight for greater accuracy. The equivalent measurements by volume are approximate.
- Reduce the chocolate and sugar - it gets too chocolately and sweet!
